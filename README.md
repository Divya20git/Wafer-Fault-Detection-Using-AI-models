# Wafer-Fault-Detection-Using-AI-models

This project explores the application of **machine learning** and **deep neural networks** for classifying defective wafers, using the **Semiconductor Manufacturing Process (SECOM)** dataset. Various methodologies were implemented and evaluated, including:

- **Sample-based & Instance-based methods**
- **Ensemble Learning** (Random Forest)
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Kâ€“Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**

The work addresses real-world manufacturing challenges such as:
- High-dimensional sensor data
- Class imbalance
- Dataset shift
- Noisy data
- Incremental learning
- Budget constraints

By analyzing production-line sensor data, this project demonstrates how predictive models can enable **early problem detection**, **enhanced defect detection**, **improved quality control**, and **waste reduction** in semiconductor manufacturing.
