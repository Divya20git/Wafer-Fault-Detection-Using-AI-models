## ðŸ“– Introduction

The rapid growth in demand for electronic devices has highlighted the critical role of semiconductor manufacturing. This process involves transforming semiconductor materials into integrated circuits with extreme precision, using advanced technologies to etch intricate patterns onto silicon wafers.

A major challenge in this domain is the limited availability of comprehensive wafer production datasets, often affected by data imbalance, noise, and high dimensionality. These issues hinder effective defect detection and quality control.

This project explores the application of **machine learning** and **deep neural networks** for classifying defective wafers, using the **Semiconductor Manufacturing Process (SECOM)** dataset. Various methodologies were implemented and evaluated, including:

- **Sample-based & Instance-based methods**
- **Ensemble Learning** (Random Forest)
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Kâ€“Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**

The work addresses real-world manufacturing challenges such as:
- High-dimensional sensor data
- Class imbalance
- Dataset shift
- Noisy data
- Incremental learning
- Budget constraints

By analyzing production-line sensor data, this project demonstrates how predictive models can enable **early problem detection**, **enhanced defect detection**, **improved quality control**, and **waste reduction** in semiconductor manufacturing.
